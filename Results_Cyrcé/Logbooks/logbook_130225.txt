Linearity tests at Cyrcé after 1 month at 20°C
Trying to get the maximum current (some ideas for the future in order the increase it more)
linear diode range from 50 to 78 (around)
diffuser 20 µm
the lower is the better for maximum beam fluence without diffusing in the room and above
Conversion factor : 0.688
Maximum intensity 25nA so 25*0.69 = 17nA on the diodes

Collimator 24mm
beam center : fixed position (cross behind the pcb)
Don't take account of X,Y values in the filename
